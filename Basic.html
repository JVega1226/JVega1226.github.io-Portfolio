            <h2>Origin's</h2>
        <p>Formula 1, or F1 for short. Traces it's orgins all the way to the 1920's, 1930's. By 1946, F1 was offically established, and the first world championship took place in 1950. 
            Driver Giuseppe Farina was the first winner. In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II regulations. This would bring balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars.
            Pre-war 4.5 liter Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the 1.5 liter pre-war 'Voiturettes'. The 3-liter Grand Prix cars were banned at the time.</p>

            <h2>Rear-Engine (Cooper)</h2>
        <p>A British car company by the name of Cooper, started building cars in a small garage in England. In 1957 Cooper Car Company introduced a mid-engine model to the grid. The T43. A engine with less power
            than the other cars on the grid. Even with less power, the engineers came to the conclusion that the layout on the T43 provided better weight distribution. Handling and traction improved with the new layout.
            By 1958 the first-ever win for a rear-engined car was achived by none other than Sterling Moss. Later in the year, driver Maurice Trintignant won the Monaco Grand Prix in a T43.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>Team Lotus (Lotus F1 Team 2012-2015) pioneered ground-effect aerodynamics, using skirts and sidepods to create huge amounts of downforce. This allowed the car to gain high speeds, while gliding through the wind.
            Renault in 1977 introduced the first turbocharged engine. Towards the mid-1980's these engines produced over 1,000 horsepower. More than any formula engine in history. Carbon fiber made it's way into F1 by
            the Mclaren team. Safe and lighter than all other material used in the past.
