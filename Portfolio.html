        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <P>Hello and welcome. My name is Jeffrey. But you can call me Jeff. I am a beginner programmer based in Southern California. I started my coding journey 2 and half years ago by taking a
            front end developer course here on codecademy. To be honest, that did not go well hahaha. I realized that I thrive better with an instructor showing me hands on. Though at the time, codecademy
            did not offer a live instructor based course, I slowly started to slide away from coding. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Developer course with codecademy,
            and let me tell you, it is awesome. I made this career change due to wanting more for myself. I always loved technlogy. The lateset and greatest. What caught my eye was the developement of it.
            How we are able to make advances in VR, self-driving cars. I want to be part of that new age. So, as I progress through the course, I will be updating this portfolio. Below you can find some of the
            projects I worked on, and some that I am currently working on to practice and better understand how to code cleanly and fluidly. Thank you and Happy Coding!!
        </P>
